                        New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                         1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                         2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                            restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                         3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                         4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                            during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                            and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                         5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                            will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.
                        Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                            If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                            referencing a part of an object.

                              Name of the cluster to install the gateway into.
                              Must match the name of the cluster that you used when you registered the cluster with Gloo.

                          trustDomain:

                              Optional: By default, the `trustDomain` value in the `meshConfig` section of the operator spec is automatically set by the Gloo to the name of each workload cluster.
                              To override the `trustDomain` for each cluster, you can instead specify the override value by using this `trustDomain` field,
                              and include the value in the list of cluster names. For example, if you specify `meshConfig.trustDomain: cluster1-trust-override` in your operator spec,
                              you then specify both the cluster name (`name: cluster1`) and the trust domain (`trustDomain: cluster1-trust-override`) in this `installations.clusters` section.
                              Additionally, because Gloo requires multiple trust domains for east-west routing, the `PILOT_SKIP_VALIDATE_TRUST_DOMAIN` field is set to `"true"` by default.

                      This base URL is used to construct the URLs for specific charts. For example, if you specify `oci://gcr.io/istio/charts` as the base URL, it is used to construct the URL to a specific chart, such as `oci://gcr.io/istio/charts/istiod`.
    
                      If no base URL is specified, the IstioLifecycleManager attempts to pull the Istio charts from a set of known repositories,
                      including the official Istio upstream repository (`oci://gcr.io/istio-release/charts`).

                        New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                         1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                         2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                            restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                         3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                         4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                            during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                            and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                         5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                            will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.
                        Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                            If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                            referencing a part of an object.

                              To override the `trustDomain` for each cluster, you can instead specify the override value by using this `trustDomain` field,
                              and include the value in the list of cluster names. For example, if you specify `meshConfig.trustDomain: cluster1-trust-override` in your operator spec,
                              you then specify both the cluster name (`name: cluster1`) and the trust domain (`trustDomain: cluster1-trust-override`) in this `installations.clusters` section.
                              Additionally, because Gloo requires multiple trust domains for east-west routing, the `PILOT_SKIP_VALIDATE_TRUST_DOMAIN` field is set to `"true"` by default.

                        in-place upgrades by skipping checks that are required for canary upgrades.
                        In production environments, canary upgrades are recommended for
                        updating the minor version. To update the patch version or make
                        configuration changes within the same version, you can use in-place upgrades.
                        Be sure to test in-place upgrades in development or staging environments first.

              `KubernetesCluster` defines a Kubernetes cluster that has been registered with Gloo Mesh for management.
              A KubernetesCluster must be created in order to connect the Gloo Mesh Agent
              with the Gloo Mesh Server.
              KubernetesCluster must be deployed to the management cluster in the `gloo-mesh` namespace.
              The name of the KubernetesCluster has to be unique among all managed workload clusters for a
              given Gloo Mesh management plane.
              The name or/and labels of a KubernetesCluster resource can be used in a Workspace resource to determine
              the workload clusters for a given workspace. **Note**: The KubernetesCluster resource name must be unique
              across the KubernetesCluster resources for other clusters that you register with Gloo. For simplicity, any
              KubernetesCluster resources that are created automatically for you during cluster registration use the same
              name as the workload cluster. However, the name of the KubernetesCluster resource
              is not required to match the name of the cluster.
    
              The following example show a simple KubernetesCluster resource named `cluster1` with `cluster.local`
              as its cluster domain:
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: KubernetesCluster
              metadata:
                name: cluster1
                namespace: gloo-mesh
              spec:
                clusterDomain: cluster.local
              ```
    
              The following example adds the region label to the KubernetesCluster resource:
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: KubernetesCluster
              metadata:
                name: cluster1
                namespace: gloo-mesh
                labels:
                  region: us-east
              spec:
                clusterDomain: cluster.local
              ```
    
              The following example excludes the cluster from safe mode:
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: KubernetesCluster

              `Workspace` describes a logical grouping of Kubernetes namespaces within the clusters that are part of
              a virtual mesh. Workspace can be treated as a boundary for configuration and service discovery.
              The specification describes how to select namespaces or/and clusters for a given workspace.
    
              The workspace-wide settings such as `importFrom`, `exportTo` are configured in the `WorkspaceSettings`
              object. Refer to the `WorkspaceSettings` documentation for details.
    
              The following example creates the `web` workspace that selects all workload clusters and all namespaces
              within those clusters to be part of the workspace.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: web
                namespace: gloo-mesh
              spec:
                workloadClusters:
                  - name: "*"
                    namespaces:
                    - name: "*"
              ```
    
              The following configuration creates the `web` workspace that selects the `web` namespace from all workload
              clusters that have the label of `region: us-east` to be part of the workspace. Refer to the `KubernetesCluster`
              documentation for examples on how to label your KubernetesCluster resource.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: web
                namespace: gloo-mesh
              spec:
                workloadClusters:
                  - selector:
                      region: us-east
                    namespaces:
                      - name: web
              ```
    
              The following example creates the `policy` namespace that does NOT have any workload clusters.
              This workspace also has the `gloo.solo.io/global` label which other workspaces
              can use to import this workspace by label in their `WorkspaceSettings` resource.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: policy
                namespace: gloo-mesh
                labels:
                  gloo.solo.io/global: 'true'
              ```
    
              The example below creates the `backend` workspace that select any namespace that starts with `ns1` in `cluster1`
              and any namespace that starts with `ns2` in `cluster2`. It has the `gloo.solo.io/exportToGateway` label,
              which other workspaces can use to import this workspace by label in their `WorkspaceSettings` resource.
              Refer to the `KubernetesCluster` documentation for examples on how to name your KubernetesCluster resource.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:

                              For example, if you have a cluster in your workspace that has three namespaces, but you want to read Gloo
                              configuration from only one of the namespaces in the cluster, you must explicitly set `configEnabled: true`
                              for the namespace to read from, and explicitly set `configEnabled: false` for the other two namespaces.

              `WorkspaceSettings` define a set of workspace-wide parameters such as `importFrom` and `exportTo` for the workspace.
              These settings are commonly defined by the workspace admin. There are 3 key configurations related to `WorkspaceSettings`:
    
              - importFrom: To import resources from another workspace to your workspace, configure the
              `importFrom` field in the `WorkspaceSettings` resource for your workspace.
    
              - exportTo: To export resources in your workspace to other workspaces, configure the `exportTo`
              field in the `WorkspaceSettings` resource for your workspace.
    
              - options: Configure service isolation, federation, proxy trimming and other options for the workspace.
    
              You can specify your workspace's `importFrom` or `exportTo` or other workspace configuration options in your
              `WorkspaceSettings` resource for your workspace. Only one `WorkspaceSettings` resource can be defined for
              each workspace. The resource can be deployed to any of your workspace's namespaces in your workload cluster(s).
    
              Export:
              Only the resources below can be exported to other workspaces:
              - Kubernetes Service
              - VirtualDestination
              - ExternalService
              - RouteTable
              - ApiDoc
              - GraphQLResolverMap
              - GraphQLSchema
              - GraphQLStitchedSchema
    
              You can use the `exportTo` field in the `WorkspaceSettings` resource for the workspace to configure what resources
              are exported to which other workspaces. For example, the `web` application developer can export the RouteTable resource
              from the `web` workspace to an admin-owned gateway workspace.
    
              The following workspace example defines the `backend` workspace. The workspace settings example
              exports the `backend` workspace to any workspaces that matches the label `team: web`.
              In addition, all exported resources from the `backend` workspace are made available
              for any workspace that has the label `team: web` to import.
    
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: backend
                namespace: gloo-mesh
                labels:
                  team: backend
              spec:
                workloadClusters:
                  - namespaces:
                    - name: backend*
              ---
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: WorkspaceSettings
              metadata:
                name: default
                namespace: backend-namespace
              spec:
                exportTo:
                  - workspaces:
                    - selector:
                        team: web
              ```
    
              Import:
              To import exported resources from other workspaces, configure the `importFrom` field in
              the `WorkspaceSettings` resource for your workspace.
    
              For example, by importing the `web` workspace, the admin-owned gateway workspace can delegate routing for a subset
              of the gateway traffic to a RouteTable resource in the `web` workspace.
    
              The following workspace defines the `web` workspace. The workspace settings example imports
              the exported resources from the `backend` workspace into the `web` workspace. The exported resources from the
              `backend` workspace is available to the `web` workspace for imports because the `web` workspace
              has the `team:web` label.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: Workspace
              metadata:
                name: web
                namespace: gloo-mesh
                labels:
                  team: web
              spec:
                workloadClusters:
                  - namespaces:
                    - name: web*
              ---
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: WorkspaceSettings
              metadata:
                name: default
                namespace: web-namespace
              spec:
                importFrom:
                  - workspaces:
                    - name: backend
              ```
    
              The following example imports any workspaces that are available for the `web` workspace to import and
              has the `team: backend` label into the `web` workspace. After this is deployed
              in the `web-namepsace` namespace of a given workload cluster that are part of the workspace,
              all exported resources from the `backend` workspaces which has the label `team: backend`
              are imported into the `web` workspace and available for use by anything in the `web` workspace.
              ```yaml
              apiVersion: admin.gloo.solo.io/v2
              kind: WorkspaceSettings
              metadata:
                name: default
                namespace: web-namepsace
              spec:
                importFrom:
                  - workspaces:
                    - selector:
                        team: backend
              ```
    
              To create global workspace settings that apply to all namespaces in all clusters, you can create a
              WorkspaceSettings resource named `global` in the admin namespace, which is typically `gloo-mesh`.
              If you have multiple workspaces, you must still create one WorkspaceSettings resource per workspaces.
              However, global workspace settings override settings defined in individual workspaces.
            properties:
              exportTo:
                description: |-
                  A workspace can specify resources to export for use by other workspaces.
                  Currently the following types of objects can be exported across workspaces: Kubernetes services, virtual destinations, external destinations, route tables,
                  API schemas, and GraphQL resolver maps.
                  You can select workspace using labels, such as setting `exportTo.workspaces.selector` to `team: backend`.
                  Or select workspace name using exact name match, such as setting `exportTo.workspaces.name` to `backend`.
                  Or exportTo all other workspaces, such as setting `exportTo.workspaces.name` to `*`.
                  Or select workspace using labels and name using simple regex, such as setting `exportTo.workspaces.selector` to `team: backend` and `team: backend*`.
                  Or select workspace name using labels or select name using simple regex, such as setting `exportTo.workspaces.selector` to `team: backend` and `exportTo.workspaces.name` to `backend`.

                      This way, you reduce the size of the proxy config to improve performance.
                      You can add destinations back into the sidecar proxy config
                      by enabling the `serviceIsolation.trimProxyConfig` field in the workspace settings or by using a `TrimProxyConfigPolicy`.
                      The preferred way is the `TrimProxyConfigPolicy`, which gives you more fine-grained control over the allowed destinations than the workspace-wide `serviceIsolation.trimProxyConfig` setting.

                          Since TLS is terminated at the East/West Gateway, the backing service (if it has a sidecar) will not be able to
                          verify the istio mTLS identity of the originating client; rather it will verify the istio mTLS cert of the East/West Gateway.

              CertificateRequests are generated by the Gloo Mesh agent installed on workload clusters.
              They are used to request a signed certificate from the certificate issuer (the Gloo Mesh server) based on a private key
              generated by the agent (which never leaves the workload cluster).
    
              When Gloo Mesh server creates an IssuedCertificate on a workload cluster, the local Gloo Mesh agent
              will generate a CertificateRequest corresponding to it.
    
              Gloo Mesh will then process the certificate signing request contained in the
              `CertificateRequestSpec` and write the signed SSL certificate back as a Kubernetes secret in the workload cluster,
              and update the `CertificateRequestStatus` to point to that secret.
    
              The certificate requested here is for Gloo Mesh agents on workload clusters to securely establish communication
              with Gloo Mesh server. This is not related to certificates for services running in the mesh.

                        New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                         1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                         2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                            restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                         3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                         4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                            during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                            and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                         5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                            will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.
                        Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                            referencing a part of an object.

              IssuedCertificates are used to issue SSL certificates
              to workload Kubernetes clusters from a central (out-of-cluster) Certificate Authority.
    
              When an IssuedCertificate is created, a certificate is issued to a workload cluster by
              a central Certificate Authority via the following workflow:
    
              1. The Certificate Issuer creates the IssuedCertificate resource on the remote cluster
              2. The Certificate Signature Requesting agent installed to the remote cluster generates
              a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and writes it to the status of the IssuedCertificate
              3. Finally, the Certificate Issuer generates a signed certificate for the CSR and writes
              it back as Kubernetes Secret in the remote cluster.
    
              Trust can therefore be established across the Gloo Mesh server cluster and agents on workload clusters
              without requiring private keys to ever leave workload clusters.
    
              The certificate requested here is for Gloo Mesh agents on workload clusters to securely establish communication
              with Gloo Mesh server. This is not related to certificates for services running in the mesh.
